\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{white}{\leavevmode {\color {white}o}}\ (Comment is too long, see the first page). Something is off with the Bayesian posterior mean in comparison to the frequentist ones. Both Jeff \& Julia and Bayesfactor seem to use $d = \mathrm {mean}(x-y)/\mathrm {sd}(x-y)$, but the R package uses $d = \sqrt {2}\mathrm {mean}(x-y)/\mathrm {sd}(x-y)$. The factor $\sqrt {2}$ seems crucial! if I add it the posterior means resembles the frequentist estimate, but the evidence is way too extreme. If I leave it out then the posterior mean appears too low although the obtained BFs are reasonable in comparison to the p-values. I did some small simulation studies, but this difference messes up the comparison so far (and ideally we use something existing for the frequentists CIs). I'm gonna look into the frequentist details on this.}{3}%
