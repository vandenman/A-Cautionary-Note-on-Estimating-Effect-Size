\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Let d be the effect size of the model averaged posterior predictive distribution. Consider the limit of d as the number of posterior predictive observations goes to infinity. Do we retrieve the model averaged posterior effect size? Intuitively yes, which could be a nice argument that the model averaged effect size can definitely be interpreted for this model.}{5}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{mypink}{\leavevmode {\color {mypink}o}}\ Which models to average? When to average? Also consider alternatively one model that has all relevant components for estimation instead of separate models.}{6}
